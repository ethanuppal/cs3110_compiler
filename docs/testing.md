# Testing

As described in the [user manual](user_manual.md), all testing can be run with `make test`.
By permission (and interest) of Professor Clarkson, we are using the framework Alcotest instead of OUnit2 (see https://tinyurl.com/alcotest-permission).

## Plan

The [test plan](../test_plan.pdf) is available in the root directory of the repository.
